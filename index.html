			<h6>
				Hansel & Gretel (2013): watched 1/24/2014
			</h6>
			<p>
				You'll be going on a witch hunting journey. I didn't feel compelled to watch this movie when it came out in theaters or when I could purchase it through the Apple store. I finally got myself to watch it with Netflix today. I must say it was entertaining - like Harry Potter was entertaining. The acting was fairly good - except for the Good White Witch's which was mediocre/bland at best. She didn't have such a big part to spoil it. My recommendation: watch with little expectation and be entertained for 87 minutes.

			<h3>Hobbies</h3>
			<h6>
				Coding: started 10/21/2013
			</h6>
			<p>
				I wrapped up with the Product and Design track at the Startup Institute last December. For our coding sessions, we spent most of our time on HTML and CSS. This website is the result of learning the basics of HTML and CSS. I found that the best resource for beginners is the HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites by Jon Duckett. I'm still in the process of adding the images for this site - will need to get much more familiar with Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.   
			</p>
			<p>
				But first...I'm spending a little more time on JavaScript with lynda.com and starting to learn the basics of Ruby on Codecademy.
			</p>
			<p>
				To be continued...
