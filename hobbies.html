			<h3>Coding</h3>

			<h6>
				Learning the Basics
			</h6>
			<p>
				I wrapped up with the Product and Design track at the Startup Institute last December. For our coding sessions, we spent most of our time on HTML and CSS. This website is the result of learning the basics of HTML and CSS. I found that the best resource for beginners is the HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites by Jon Duckett. I'm still in the process of adding the images for this site - will need to get much more familiar with Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.   
			</p>
			<p>
				But first...I'm spending a little more time on JavaScript with lynda.com and starting to learn the basics of Ruby on Codecademy.
			</p>
			<p>
				To be continued...

			<h3>Cooking</h3>

				What's cooking this weekend

			<h6>
				Delivery
			</h6>
			<p>
				On the days that you just want to kick back but still eat tasty food - I'm happy to note that I still can do it. One of the luxuries of living in New York include lots of restaurants that deliver to your doorstep. It's really great especially when it's frigid outside - like it is in NY now - and on a Friday when you are tired from the week. I could not get this in Chicago, San Francisco, and Los Angeles (not nearly as many options).

			</p>
			<p>
				What's for dinner tonight? Yummy chicken tikka masala and garlic nan from Tamarind.

			Classes
		</h6>
			<p>
				Barry's Bootcamp has been really fun. I've not been consistent about how many days a week I go. The range is from 2-4 now. Goal: steady 4 times a week for the next 3 months.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm working to strengthen the muscles around my knees. I'm at a shabby 8.0 sprint, 5.5-6.0 run, 4.5 jog. Goal: increase by 1 point a month for the next three months.
